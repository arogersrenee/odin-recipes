    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sweet and swirled Iced Lemon Loaf. Better than any coffee shop, this bread melts in your mouth. Doughy lemon loaf cake with just the right amount of lemon, sweetened with honey, and made fluffy. It’s extra special with a swirl of cream cheese and finished simply with a thick and creamy lemon glaze. This lemon loaf has such a nice spring vibe, plus it’s easier than you’d think to make.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) salted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon zest, plus 3 tablespoons juice</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plain greek yogurt or sour cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350° F. Grease a (9×5 inch) loaf pan.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat together the butter, honey, and 1 tablespoon lemon zest until combined. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until combined, then add the lemon juice, vanilla, and yogurt. It's going to look curdled. Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Beat until just combined.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the cream cheese and 1 tablespoon lemon zest.</li>
        <li>Spoon 1/3 of the batter into the prepared pan. Dollop teaspoon size amounts of the cream cheese over the batter, using half the cream cheese. Gently swirl the cheese using a paring knife. Spoon over another 1/3 of the batter, then swirl in the remaining cream cheese, then spoon the remaining batter over. It's OK if all the cream cheese is not covered. Bake for 45 minutes, or until the center is just set. If the cake is browning, cover with foil to finish baking.</li>
        <li>Let cool completely before frosting.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the glaze. In a bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, lemon juice, and honey. Pour the glaze over the loaf. Let set 1 hour (or so), slice and eat</li>
    </ol>
