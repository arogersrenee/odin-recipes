    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Like clockwork, every single January, I seem to share banana bread. It’s not something I do intentionally, it’s
        more so that my family just loves banana bread. And personally, I love making it. Banana bread was a recipe my
        mom and I would make when I was a kid.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium overly ripe bananas mashed (about 1 1/4 cup mashed)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted coconut oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pure maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour (or all-purpose flour)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup walnuts (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350° F. Grease a 9×5 inch bread pan.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, stir together the mashed bananas, coconut oil, maple syrup, eggs, and vanilla until combined. Add
            the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt, mix until just combined. Fold in the walnuts, if using. </li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the center is just set. Remove and
            let cool for 30 minutes before cutting…or just eat it warm with a smear of cinnamon butter. Enjoy!</li>
        <li>To make the cinnamon butter, In a bowl, beat the butter, maple syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger,
            cloves, and a pinch of salt. Serve with the warm bread.</li>
    </ol>
